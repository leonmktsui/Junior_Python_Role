## Junior Python Role - Portfolio Analyser
This was a brief project built to analyse a portfolio of shares with a sample dataset. 

## Motivation
Python, Pandas and SQL combine excellently to analyse large amounts of data. 
And out of passion (and the need create this for a job assessment) I created this project.

## Build status

This will continually be improved as I improve my skills in the above languages. 

## Installation

More Information for both Windows and Mac Installations of Python

Requires Python installation - should already be installed on systems with macOS. 
Packages used:

## How to use?
Download and extract the junior_trader_test.zip file

Open up a Terminal console
Cd to the directory, 
Make sure the data set in the same directory
