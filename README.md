## Junior Python Role - Portfolio Analyser
This was a brief project built to analyse a portfolio of shares with a sample dataset. 

## Motivation
Python, Pandas and SQL combine excellently to analyse large amounts of data. 
And out of passion (and the need create this for a job assessment) I created this project.

## Build status

This will continually be improved as I improve my skills in the above languages. 

## Installation

More Information for both Windows and Mac Installations of Python
https://realpython.com/installing-python/

Requires Python installation - should already be installed on systems with macOS. 
Packages used: 
Pandas
pandasql
SQLAlchemy

For each package simply type "pip install [package name]"

## How to use?
Download and extract the junior_trader_test.zip file

Open up a Terminal console
Cd to the directory, 
Make sure the data set in the same directory 
Then type "python profit_and_loss.py"

The script will run and the sample dataset will be analysed for Current Positions, Profit and Loss (Realised and Unrealised) including a breakdown list of trades you made at a profit or loss.

#### Anything else that seems useful
Thank you for your time, it has been a very interesting learning experience to mesh together stocks and shares knowledge along with my Python and mySQL skills.
